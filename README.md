# home_credit
This repository contains an end-to-end credit risk analytics project developed using SQL, Python, and Power BI.  The project demonstrates how multi-table financial data can be transformed into actionable insights through  risk segmentation, behavioural analysis, and policy-driven scenario modelling.
Due to GitHub file size limitations, the original dataset has been compressed and uploaded as a ZIP archive. 
All data files can be extracted locally to reproduce the analysis and dashboards.
